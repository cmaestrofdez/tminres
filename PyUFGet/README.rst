PyUFGet: Search and download sparse matrices from the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection
====================================================================================================

About
=====

I recently needed to download some test matrices from the `University
of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection`_. Unfortunately I noticed that
the existing Python interface would only let me download matrices by
their IDs and there was no way to filter matrices before downloading
them. While this functionality was available in the MATLAB and Java
implementations, there was no convenient way to use it from my
(PyUnit-based) tests.

I therefore set out to create my own little utility to search, filter
and download sparse matrices from Python. The index of matrices is
created from the same CSV file used by the Java interface. However, I
persist the index in a SQLite database so I do not have to parse CSV
files more than once and I can easily map all filters, no matter how
complex to SQLite's dialect of SQL. Hopefully, it should also make it
easier to create ports of this utility to other languages and
environments without having to duplicate a lot of the functionality. 

The functionality provided by ``PyUFGet`` should be roughly on par with
the Java interface (of course without the whizbang GUI :-)). I might
add a GUI on top of the search/download functionality once I'm
sufficiently motivated to learn WxPython or PyQT.

Requirements and installation
=============================

I have tried to keep the list of prerequisites as small as
possible. You therefore only need stock Python 2.6 or higher to run
``PyUFGet``; you do not need NumPy, SciPy, HDF5 or other non-standard
packages.

To install, simply download the ``PyUFGet`` directory and add it to
your ``PYTHONPATH``. Alternatively, download the ``distutils``-based
zip file in the ``dist`` directory, unzip it and run ``python setup.py
install``.

From Python, ``import PyUFGet`` and type ``help(PyUFGet)`` to get a detailed
help message on how to use ``PyUFGet`` to search and download sparse matrices.

From the command-line, run ``python PyUFGet`` or ``python PyUFGet --help`` to see the
list of options.

Examples
========

Make sure you first run ``from PyUFGet import search, fetch``. Replace
``fetch`` with ``search`` to only return the corresponding ``Matrix`` objects
without downloading them.

* Download matrix with ID 42 in the MatrixMarket format: ``fetch(42)``
* Download matrices in the Harwell-Boeing collection with less than
  1000 non-zeros: ``fetch(group = 'HB', nzbounds = (None, 1000))``
* Download only the first 5 problems arising from structural analysis:
  ``fetch(kind = "structural", limit = 5)``
* Download the problems in the previous example as MATLAB .MAT files: ``fetch(kind = "structural", format = "MAT", limit = 5)``


Coming Soon .. *in stereo*
==========================
* The index currently needs to be manually refreshed. I will make the
  process less sucky.
